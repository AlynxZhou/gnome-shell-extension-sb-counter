# The Joke

## 中文版本

我看到 Hackghost 的桌面上有一个计数器，上面显示数字“233”，于是我好奇地去问他这个计数器代表什么意思。他回答说：“这个数字代表了我今天被蠢货们打断了工作的次数”。说完他又按了一下计数器按钮，于是现在数字变为“234”了。

## English Version Translated by AlynxZhou

I saw a counter on Hackghost's desktop showing a number "233", and I asked him what it means curiously. He said "that represents how many times I was interrupted by idiots today". After speaking he pressed the button of the counter again, and then the number became "234".

# Usage

```
$ git clone https://github.com/AlynxZhou/gnome-shell-extension-sb-counter.git ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/sbcounter@alynx.one

Restart GNOME Shell or run `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/sbcounter@alynx.one/sbcounter-clear.js` to reset the counter.
